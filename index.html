Monthly Competition 1
</div>

<p style="font-size:80%">
The sounds of a whirling fan hits you, as the dimly lit room comes into your view. There is a lamp illuminating the scene, where a compact machine displaying colorful lights and various values are updating its states by the frame, awaiting your decisions as it churns away, progressing the simulation it was not designed for. A marvel of technology condensed into a singular device to have been named a computer bringing its user convenience, utility and entertainment, where anything is possible. Surely, with its power, there are a vast amount of things to do other than playing simple games where numbers are going up.

The Contest
</div>

<p>
You and your team will play three incremental games, to be chosen by Uni out of prejudice and bias. Exchanging save files between your team during the contest is allowed, and multiple players, or one single player, may be allowed to be playing from none to all games at any time.
</p>

<p>
However, all games must be new save files started within the start of the contest and you are to play the games as-is, without using scripts or tools that play the game for you, an example being autoclickers. You are allowed to use spreadsheets, external calculators or snippets that do not interact with the game beyond reading game states, such as calculating the datetime of when you can buy the next thing.
</p>

<p>All games will be web games so phones are not needed.</p>

The Format
</div>

<p>Each team is of from 1 to 3 people. Teams may designate a Captain, a Major and/or a Vanguard, but this is optional and not everyone or anyone needs a title, it is for aesthetics purposes for the charts only.</p>

<p>Each game in the competition is a tournament bracket of its own. Teams are ranked differently for each bracket based on progress, and the team to have progressed the furthest in a game gets the maximum number of points, the next team gets one fewer point, followed by one fewer, etc, down to one point. The total, final score is the sum of all three scores for all three games played.</p>

<p>Progress is to be determined by Uni based on subjective criteria after looking at your save file.</p>

<p>Uni's team is not allowed to get any points since Uni runs the contest.</p>

<p>Everything happens on discord.</p>
